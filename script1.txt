Oh!
Hello there!
You just stumbled out of the woods, eh?
Looks like we've got another one.

<press space>

Here's how it works.
That keyboard in front of you in _your_ world?
That is about to become *invisible*!
You won't be able to see to type anymore.

I'm sorry to bring you the bad news.

But, I've got a *present* for you!
This *magical keyboard* which shows up in _our_ world!

<bless f>
<bless j>

There we are!  Now, stick your index fingers on the [F] and [J] keys. They're near the middle. Keep them there forever!
Now, if you aren't already, you'll need to use one of your *thumbs* to press the spacebar!

<press space>

Did you look at the keyboard to find the [F] and [J]?
Okay, that's the last time you can do that.
Because, as I said, that keyboard is about to become *invisible*!
Oh, and look! The [F] and [J] are now labeled on the keyboard!
Yay!

<press space>

You used a thumb to press the spacebar, right?
Well, I really must be off. You caught me at lunch time.
At least you know enough to get to Home Town.
Off you go!
